## Main Column Title

I want the gt table to be centered in the main column. Right now it spans between the margin and the main column. Using tab_options(table.align='left') puts the table all the way to the left. I would prefer to not save the gt tables as temporary pngs. The r chunk option of fig.align does not seem to work with the gt table. 
`r margin_note("This is what text in the margin looks like.")`
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Random tibble with data

tibble(subject = "Joe",
       ytreat = "13",
       ycontrol = "9",
       ydiff = "+4") %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt()
```
